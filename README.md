- 👋 Hi, I’m Elias Rosenblatt. I am currently a postdoc researcher at the University of Vermont studying SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife communities.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on source code and package development for ecological network models that integrate community ecology and disease ecology for decision making analysis.

- 📫 You can contact me at erosenbl@uvm.edu, and check out my broader lab group with Dr. Brittany Mosher https://brittany-a-mosher.mystrikingly.com.
